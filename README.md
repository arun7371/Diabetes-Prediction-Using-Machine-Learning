# Diabetes-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for the detection of diabetes using a dataset that includes various health-related features. The dataset is loaded from a CSV file, and several preprocessing steps are performed to enhance the quality of the data before training a RandomForestClassifier.
